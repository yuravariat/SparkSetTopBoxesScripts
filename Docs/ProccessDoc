General:

    1. Translated programs for specific period [TranslatedPrograms]
    2. Statistic, what programs where watched most [ProgramsRates]

Programs matrix creation:


    1. Flat xml data [refxml] of devices per day to csv format [refcsv]. [C# function FlatRefXMLAll() Data parser project]
        [input]=refcsv output=refcsv

    2. Create unique devices data general and unique devices with one device per household. [Create_Unique_Devices_List]
            [input]=refcsv [output]=y_devices/unique_devices_one_dev_in_house

    3. Create data of views(with programs durations) and logs(only OFF events). [CreateLogsAndViewsUnion]
        [input]=rpt_programs,rpt_prog_view,rawxml [output]=y_views_logs_union

    4. Create data of all views with their real watch durations. [CreateViewsWithDurations]
         [input]=y_views_logs_union [output]=y_views_with_durations

    5. Create devices appearances table. Each device and all dates where it appears.
        Not including MP_MISSINGPROGRAM, DVRPGMKEY codes and views less then 5 minutes. [Create_Devices_Appearances_By_Views]
        [input]=refcsv [output]=devices\devices_appearances_by_views

    6. Create programs groups. all programs translated in first 5 months grouped by name [ProgramGroups]
       (same program can be translated with several ids)
       [input]=rpt_programs [output]=y_programs/programs_groups

    7. Check most effective time period for learning and prediction with [Create_Devices_Appearances_By_Views_Check]
        [input]=devices\devices_appearances_by_views

    8. Save devices for each city to optimize matrix creation [Select_Devices_ByConstrains]

    9. Create Matrix with [CreateProgramsVectors]

    10. Runing K-Means algorithm for range of k. [KMeansRun].
       Original vectors with cluster classifications stored in [output]/k_#/prediction
       [input]=y_for_clustering/5_months/+city_name+_vect
       [output]=y_clustering_results/5_months/city_name+_vect

    11. Find time differences with [Find_Time_Differences] for each city/area.
       Translation time zone not equal to view watch time zone

    12. Run prediction [RunProgPredict]
        [input]=y_clustering_results/5_months/city_name+_vect
        [output]=y_predictions/5_months/city_name+_vect

    13. Run Prediction statistics [ProgPredictResultsShow]



Program prediction

    1. Run ver each views of each device. On each device view program will be predicted with currently translate programs
        rated by means vector of cluster that device is belong to. [RunProgPredict]
        [input]=clustered data, transalted programs, devices with views. [output]=???


Run command:  spark-shell --driver-memory 10G --executor-memory 18G -i test.scala


Programs matrix creation old:


    1. Flat xml data [refxml] of devices per day to csv format [refcsv]. [C# function FlatRefXMLAll() Data parser project]
        [input]=refcsv output=refcsv

    2. Create devices appearances table. Each device and all dates where it appears. [Create_Devices_Appearances_By_Dates]
        [input]=refcsv [output]=devices\devices_appearances
        * Show devices counts with full history for a year per city [Devices_With_appearances_By_Cities]
        [input]=devices\devices_appearances

    3. Save devices with history with at least 120 first history days per cities (One device per houseHold).
        [Devices_With_appearances_Save_By_City]
        [input]=devices\devices_appearances [output]=devices/devices_120_hist_+city_name

    4. Collect logs and views from selected cities and place them in one folder order by datetime [Devices_Watch_History_Collect]
        [input]=devices/devices_120_hist_+city_name [output]=devices_views/devices_120_hist_+city_name+_ordered

    5. Calculate precise views duration with logs and programs translations data. [Calculate_durations]
        Then place them in other folder.
        [input]=devices_views/devices_120_hist_+city_name+_ordered [output]=devices_views/devices_120_hist_+city_name+_ord_dur

    6. Find time differences with [Find_Time_Differences]. Translation time zone not equal to view watch time zone

    7. Create programs groups. all programs translated in first 5 months grouped by name
        (same program can be translated with several ids)
        [input]=rpt_programs [output]=y_programs/programs_groups

    8. Create devices x programs matrix. Each device number of views for each program.
        Don't take account view with duration less then 5 minutes, strange programs(list in code)
        and devices with small amount of views(not much but still exist despite of appearances table)
        Final step normalization. [CreateProgramsVectors]
        [input]=y_programs/programs_groups | devices_views/devices_120_hist_+city_name+_ord_dur
        [output]=y_for_clustering/devices_120_hist_+city_name+_progs_vect

Clustering

    1. Runing K-Means algorithm for range of k. [KMeansRun].
